Welcome to the GitHub repository of the online fan-made spin-off of the popular mobile game, [Ready Steady Bang](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ready-steady-bang/id447588618)! This is a free-to-play web version that brings the fast-paced, quick-fire duelling experience to your browser. It's a great way to enjoy the game with friends or challenge other players from around the world.

This project is currently in development/pre-alpha stage and is not meant to infringe on any rights of the original creators ([Animade Studio](https://animade.tv/projects/cowboy-games)).
